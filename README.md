# Booktracker

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.2.0.

Following along with the Pluralsight course [Angular HTTP Communication](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/angular-http-communication/table-of-contents) by [Brice Wilson](https://github.com/bricewilson)

The code in this app was downloaded from the exercise files in that course and then upgraded to use the latest version of [Angular](https://angular.io/) and [RxJS](https://rxjs-dev.firebaseapp.com/).

## Development server

Run `npm start` for a dev server runing both the [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) server and Angular client applications.  Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/`.  The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

Run `ng serve` for a dev server with only the client Angular app.  Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`.  The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
Before running the tests make sure you are serving the app via `ng serve`.
